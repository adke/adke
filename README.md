## Hello Everyone, Iâ€™m Adish ðŸ‘‹

#### I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo attending the Computer Engineering Program. 
- :iphone:My deepest passion and interest is programming and is why I have chosen to make this GitHub portfolio. For the entirety of my life, I have enjoyed solving complex puzzles and mathematical problems.
Due to this reason, I have indulged myself into the tech world for some time now and initiated my coding adventure with Python at an introductory level. I then, switched 
to web design; developing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS at an entry level and later on, I extensively learned about Java and C++.


- :coffee:Currently, I am trying to hone my skills in Python, working extensively on projects relating to Machine and Deep Learning by using libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Later on, I would like to explore other aspects of AI such as Natural Language Processing, Speech Recognition, and Computer Vision. Artificial Intelligence is definitely a demanding and growing field therefore, I am very curious to see its potential and the positive impact(s) it can make to our society. 


- :computer:I have listed some of the projects that I have done onto this portfolio. I hope you enjoy it and see, some of my skills and talents in
programming and software development!
