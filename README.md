## Hello Everyone, Iâ€™m Adish ðŸ‘‹

#### I am currently a student at the University of Waterloo attending the Computer Engineering Program. 
- :iphone:Programming is my most profound passion and interest, which is why I've created this GitHub portfolio. Throughout my life, I've derived immense satisfaction from tackling intricate puzzles and mathematical challenges. This enduring enthusiasm led me to immerse myself in the world of technology, embarking on my coding journey with Python. Subsequently, I delved into web design, honing my proficiency in Front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React, while mastering Java Spring and PostgreSQL for Back-end development. Later, I expanded my knowledge by studying Java and C++ extensively.


- :coffee:At present, my primary focus is on enhancing my Python skills, with a strong emphasis on engaging in projects related to Machine and Deep Learning. I utilize a variety of powerful libraries, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. With my current level of expertise, I'm proficient in creating Transformer-based LLM (Large Language Model) models capable of generating code through meticulous pre-training and fine-tuning processes. In the future, I aspire to delve into other facets of Artificial Intelligence, such as Quantitative Trading and Computer Vision. Artificial Intelligence is a dynamic and burgeoning field, which has ignited my curiosity about its boundless potential and the positive impacts it can bring to our society. 


- :computer:In this portfolio, I've cataloged a selection of the projects I've undertaken. I hope you find them enjoyable and gain insight into some of my programming and software development skills and talents!
