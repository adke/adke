## Hello Everyone, I’m Adish 👋

#### I am currently a high school student attending, Henry Wise Wood Senior High in Calgary, Alberta. 
- 👀 My deepest passion and interest is programming and is why I have chosen to make this GitHub portfolio. For the entirety of my life, I have enjoyed solving complex puzzles and mathematical problems.
Due to this reason, I have indulged myself into the tech world for some time now and initiated my coding adventure with Python at an introductory level. I then, switched 
to web design; developing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS at an entry level and later on, I extensively learned about Java. 


- 🌱 Currently, I am continuing to hone my skills in Java, learning about Iterative and Recursive Algorithims in great dept. Later on,
I will be looking at Dynamic Data Structures, specifically Linked Lists and Array Lists. Hopefully as I make progress in this exciting and long coding journey,
I can make a front-end develeped website that will list all the accomplishments I have made, using my software and hardware knowledge. 


- 💞️ I have listed some of the projects that I have done onto this portfolio. I hope you enjoy it and see, some of my skills and talents in
programming and hardware design!
